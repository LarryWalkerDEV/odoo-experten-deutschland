# DigitalOcean Static Website Hosting Setup

## What We've Done:

1. **Deleted the App Platform app** - It was causing DNS conflicts and charging you
2. **Pushed static files to GitHub** - Clean static site on `static-site` branch
3. **Now we need to set up proper static hosting**

## Option 1: DigitalOcean Spaces (Recommended)

DigitalOcean Spaces can host static websites for $5/month with unlimited sites.

### Steps:
1. Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces
2. Create a new Space:
   - Name: `odoo-experten-deutschland`
   - Region: Frankfurt
   - Enable CDN
   - Enable "Static Website Hosting"
   - Index Document: `index.html`
   - Error Document: `404.html`

3. Upload your static files
4. Set up custom domain in Spaces settings
5. Update DNS to point to Space

## Option 2: Create New App as Pure Static Site

Create a new app with this minimal configuration:

```yaml
name: odoo-experten-deutschland
static_sites:
  - name: web
    github:
      repo: LarryWalkerDEV/odoo-experten-deutschland
      branch: static-site
    source_dir: /
```

No buildpacks, no build commands = FREE hosting

## Option 3: Use Netlify or Vercel (FREE)

Both offer free static hosting:
- Connect GitHub repo
- Select `static-site` branch
- Deploy instantly
- Add custom domain

## DNS Fix After Choosing Option:

Once you choose where to host:
1. Clean up DigitalOcean DNS zone
2. Point domain to new hosting
3. SSL certificate will auto-generate

Your static site is ready on GitHub `static-site` branch!
