# GoDaddy DNS Fix - The RIGHT Way

## The Problem:
- DigitalOcean App Platform doesn't provide static IPs
- You need to use CNAME records instead of A records
- GoDaddy should point to your DigitalOcean app URL

## IMMEDIATE FIX in GoDaddy:

### Step 1: Delete Bad Records
In GoDaddy DNS management:
1. DELETE all A records pointing to DigitalOcean IPs
2. DELETE CNAME record for www if it exists
3. KEEP your nameservers as GoDaddy default

### Step 2: Add Correct CNAME
Add this CNAME record:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: odoo-experten-deutschland-ilsoe.ondigitalocean.app
TTL: 600
```

### Step 3: Forward Root Domain
In GoDaddy Domain Settings:
1. Go to "Forwarding" section
2. Set up forwarding:
   - Forward to: https://www.odoo-experten-deutschland.de
   - Type: Permanent (301)
   - Forward settings: Forward only

## Why This Works:
- www.odoo-experten-deutschland.de → CNAME → Your DigitalOcean app
- odoo-experten-deutschland.de → Forwards to → www version
- No IP conflicts, no DNS zone issues

## After Setting This Up:
1. Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Test www.odoo-experten-deutschland.de first
3. Then test odoo-experten-deutschland.de (should redirect)

## Important:
- DO NOT use DigitalOcean nameservers
- DO NOT create A records
- Just use CNAME + Forwarding

This is the standard way to point a domain to DigitalOcean App Platform!
