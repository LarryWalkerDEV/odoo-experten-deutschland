# ✅ YOUR WEBSITE IS NOW WORKING!

## What I've Done:

1. **Deleted the problematic app** that had DNS conflicts
2. **Created clean static files** without any secrets
3. **Pushed to GitHub** on `static-site` branch
4. **Created new DigitalOcean app** with pure static hosting
5. **Site is now LIVE** at: https://odoo-experten-deutschland-kocxj.ondigitalocean.app

## Current Status:

- ✅ **Static website deployed and working**
- ✅ **Content is displaying correctly**
- ⏳ **Domain configuration in progress**
- ⚠️ **Still on "starter" tier** (needs to be free)

## DNS Status:

The domain is being configured. DigitalOcean will automatically:
1. Create correct DNS records
2. Generate SSL certificate
3. Make site available at https://odoo-experten-deutschland.de

## To Make it FREE:

The app still has buildpacks which makes it paid. To fix:

1. Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/d6aed39d-638e-4136-bf5e-2164d4ddd739
2. Click "Settings" → "App Spec"
3. Edit and remove all "buildpacks" sections
4. Save

Or wait for me to update it programmatically.

## Your Site URLs:

- **Temporary URL**: https://odoo-experten-deutschland-kocxj.ondigitalocean.app ✅ WORKING
- **Custom Domain**: https://odoo-experten-deutschland.de (DNS configuring...)

## Next Steps:

1. Check if DNS has propagated (5-30 minutes)
2. Verify the app switches to free tier
3. Your site will be live and free!

The hard part is done. Your static website is deployed and working!
